# Paper Title: *[FLIP: FLOW-CENTRIC GENERATIVE PLANNING FOR GENERAL-PURPOSE MANIPULATION TASKS]*  
**Authors**: [Prof shao lin , nus]

## 1. Summary
- **Problem Addressed**: 
1. generates image flows (future trajectories on query points) as actions for planning.
2.  flow-conditioned video generation network D generates the following L frames based on current image observation history, the language goal g, and the predicted flow
pt:t+L to enable iterative planning for the next planning step.
3.  The value module V assigns an estimated value V t for each frame ot to enable model-based planning on the image space.
