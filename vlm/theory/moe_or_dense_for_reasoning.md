## 1. Summary
- **Problem Addressed**: does MOE better than dense on reasoning?
- **Results**: Moe is worse than dense on reasoning-intensive tasks. On the other hand, Moe is better than Dense becasue it can  efficiently memorize data.

## 3. Key Takeaways
- Do not use Moe in reasnoning task, if you want efficient, use  Monarch Mixer,Exploring Low Rank Training of Deep Neural Networks(jimmy ba), etc.
